Number Guessing Game 
= My first java project from cs20 so it's pretty basic but I thought I might as well document it because why not...

To run the program, download the repository (aka the one single file lol) and run it as a java project.
The program will prompt you what to do from there.

In this program:
- You have three tries to guess a randomly generated number
- Choose which difficulty you'd like (numbers between 1-10, 1-50 or 1-100)
- The game will tell you how relatively close you are to the number with "hot, warm or cold"
- You have the choice to keep playing or to quit after each round
- Number of games played / wins / losses are documented
- The coolest feature is that in 1 fifth of the rounds, it is impossible to guess the number on the first try

Error trapping algorithms are in place to avoid program crashes due to unexpected input.
